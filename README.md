VoiceShop is a multimodal, voice-driven shopping assistant that retrieves grounded product recommendations from a curated Amazon dataset and optionally refreshes results with live web information.  
The system integrates **LangGraph multi-agent orchestration**, **MCP tools**, **private RAG**, **Whisper ASR**, **TTS**, and a **React UI** to support an end-to-end voice-to-voice product search experience.

## 📊 Dataset Summary

We curated the **Amazon 2020 Toys & Games** category, producing a clean subset of **6,662 products**.  
The dataset lacks **brand** and **rating**, but we preserve these schema fields for compatibility with Amazon’s structure and future extensions.

Each product is embedded using a sentence-transformer model and stored in a ChromaDB index for hybrid semantic + metadata retrieval.

## 🧩 Multi-Agent System (LangGraph)

We use four specialized agents to ensure structured reasoning and grounded tool-use:

- **Router** — interprets user intent, constraints, and signals such as “needs live price.”
- **Planner** — selects tools (rag.search, web.search) and formulates an execution plan.
- **Retriever** — calls the MCP tools and gathers evidence.
- **Reconciler / Answerer** — merges private + live data and generates the grounded final response.

This design provides a deterministic, transparent pipeline where each agent has a clear role.

---

## 🔌 MCP Tools

### **rag.search**
Retrieves structured product data from the private ChromaDB index.  
Used for all primary recommendations.

### **web.search**
Fetches live price or availability when users ask for *“latest price,” “current,” “under \$X,”* etc.  
Used selectively to reduce latency.

Together, these tools provide grounded, reproducible, and up-to-date product information.

---

## 📁 Prompt Disclosure

All system and agent prompts required for DSAN grading are included:

/prompts
├── system.txt
├── router.txt
├── planner.txt
└── answerer.txt


These define the behaviors of all agents in the LangGraph pipeline.
